- Create "formattedBalances" function but don't use it.
- "lhsPriority" is not defined but is used to consider conditions.
- If you have used  "filter", you should not "return" it.
- Define type is complicated, the "interface" is not clearly understood.
- usdValue is passed directly to props instead of creating a variable like the template.
